# Blog Content Improvements - Google Ads Compliance Enhancement

## Changes Made

### 1. Runtime Error Fixed
- Removed the `throw new Error(...)` statement from `src/App.tsx` that was causing application crashes
- Cleaned up the file to restore normal functionality

### 2. Content Removed
- Deleted intermittent fasting blog posts (Spanish and English) as requested
- These were deemed too diet-specific and potentially problematic for Google Ads approval

### 3. Nutrition Labels Blog Posts Rewritten

#### Content Strategy Changes:
- **From Technical to Personal**: Transformed dry, bullet-point heavy content into engaging personal narratives
- **Storytelling Integration**: Each blog now starts with a relatable personal story (yogurt shopping revelation)
- **Conversational Tone**: Replaced formal "In this article we will explore..." with "I was standing in the grocery store..."
- **Reduced Bullet Points**: Converted most lists into flowing paragraphs while keeping essential tables for data
- **Human Experience Focus**: Emphasized personal learning journey and mistakes made

#### Google Ads Compliance Improvements:
- **Narrative Structure**: Personal story format is more engaging and less AI-generated sounding
- **Practical Application**: Focus on real-world shopping experiences rather than abstract nutritional advice
- **Balanced Information**: Presents information as personal experience rather than medical advice
- **Relatable Content**: Uses common shopping scenarios that readers can identify with

### 4. Content Quality Enhancements

#### Spanish Version (`es/como-leer-etiquetas-nutricionales.md`):
- Personal discovery story about comparing yogurts
- Narrative flow with sections like "Mi Primer Momento de Claridad" and "Cuando Descubrí los Azúcares Ocultos"
- Maintained essential nutritional information within engaging storytelling
- Added personal limits and strategies as examples rather than prescriptions

#### English Version (`en/how-to-read-nutrition-labels.md`):
- Mirror structure with culturally appropriate adaptations
- Personal anecdotes about "nutrition detective" journey
- Maintained technical accuracy while improving readability
- Focus on empowerment through knowledge rather than diet prescription
