When temperatures climb, hydration is more of a planning problem than a willpower test. The goal is steady intake—small sips across hours—so your body can regulate temperature without leaving you bloated or light‑headed. A simple plan you can repeat beats extreme rules you abandon by day two.

## What to drink (and when)
Water covers most everyday needs. For long outdoor work or repeated heat exposure, add electrolytes. Think in phases: start the day hydrated, sip regularly, include fluids with meals, and add electrolytes after heavy sweating. Choose drinks you’ll actually consume consistently—milk, diluted juice, or unsweetened iced tea can all fit.

Electrolyte products are tools, not requirements. For significant losses or stomach upset, consider an oral rehydration solution (ORS) with appropriate sodium and glucose. Commercial options and WHO‑style formulas target effective absorption through sodium–glucose co‑transport; avoid very high sugar mixes that can worsen GI symptoms.

## Food that contributes
Fruits, vegetables, yogurt, and soups provide meaningful fluid and electrolytes. Cold foods—orange slices, cucumbers, frozen berries—reduce the effort of drinking when it’s hot. After intense sweat, pairing water with salty foods (e.g., soup, olives, cheese, salted crackers) can help restore balance.

Hyponatremia is rare but risky: hours of heavy sweating + large volumes of plain water can dilute sodium. If your day involves sustained exertion in heat, include sodium sources and consider an electrolyte beverage.

## Simple planning for hot days
- Build cues: keep a bottle in sight, set light reminders, and drink with each meal and break.
- Schedule around heat: do intense tasks earlier or later and take shade breaks.
- Prep one cold option at home: a pitcher of water, ice, or ORS packets.

If you care for children, older adults, or pregnant people, set check‑ins. Heat affects these groups differently; plan rest, shade, and fluids proactively.

## When to seek help
Dehydration can show up as persistent thirst, dark urine, fatigue, dizziness, headache, or confusion. Vomiting, fainting, or signs of heat illness warrant urgent medical care. During pregnancy, heat can pose additional risks—follow clinical guidance and avoid prolonged exposure.
