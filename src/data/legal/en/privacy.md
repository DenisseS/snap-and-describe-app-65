# Privacy Policy

Your privacy matters to us. This page outlines how we protect and handle your information.

## Our Privacy-First Approach

We believe nutrition should be personal and private. That's why we've built our nutrition platform with privacy at its core - your personal health data stays with you, whether stored locally on your device or in your personal cloud storage. We fundamentally respect your privacy and have designed our entire system around this principle.

Unlike many health and nutrition apps, we don't collect, store, analyze, or sell your personal information to third parties. Your nutrition data, food preferences, health goals, and usage patterns remain completely private and under your control.

## What We Don't Do - Our Privacy Guarantees

**No Personal Data Collection:** We don't collect, store, or process your personal nutrition information, dietary preferences, health goals, weight data, or any personally identifiable health information. This data stays exclusively on your device or in your chosen cloud storage.

**No Data Sales or Sharing:** We will never sell, rent, lease, or share your personal data with third parties for their marketing, advertising, or commercial purposes. Your information is not a commodity to us.

**No Cross-Site Tracking:** We don't track you across websites or build behavioral profiles. Our advertising is contextual - based on the nutrition content you're currently viewing, not on your personal data or browsing history.

**No Data Mining:** We don't analyze your usage patterns, nutrition choices, or health data for commercial purposes or to create user profiles for targeted advertising.

## How Your Data Works - Complete Ownership

**Local Device Storage:** All your nutrition data, meal tracking, favorites, shopping lists, and personal preferences are stored locally on your device using secure browser storage. This means only you have direct access to your information - we cannot access, view, or retrieve your personal data.

**Optional Cloud Synchronization:** If you choose to enable cloud sync through Dropbox, your data is transferred directly from your device to your personal Dropbox account. We act only as a bridge - your data passes through our system but is never stored on our servers or accessible to our team.

**Complete Data Ownership:** You maintain full ownership and control over all your data. You can export your complete nutrition history, delete all data, transfer to another device, or disconnect cloud sync at any time without restriction.

**Data Portability:** Your data is stored in standard formats, making it easy to export and import into other applications if you choose to switch platforms.

## Cookies & Advertising

We use minimal cookies to keep our lights on (and buy coffee for our dev team!). Here's what we use:

### Google Ads Cookies
We use Google Ads to show relevant advertisements based on the content you're viewing. These ads help us keep the app free and fund development. The ads are contextual - they're based on the nutrition content you're reading, not on tracking your personal data.

### Essential Cookies
We use minimal essential cookies for basic functionality like remembering your language preference and ensuring the app works properly.

### Cookie Preferences Management
You can manage your cookie preferences at any time by visiting our [Cookie Preferences Center](#cookie-preferences). There you can:
- Enable or disable different types of cookies
- View detailed information about what cookies we use
- Save your personalized preferences

## Limited Information We Collect

We collect minimal information to operate our service and improve the user experience:

**Anonymous Usage Analytics:** We collect aggregated, anonymous statistics about app usage (such as which features are most popular, general performance metrics, and error rates) to help us improve the platform. This data is completely anonymized and cannot be linked back to individual users.

**Technical Error Reports:** When the app encounters technical issues, we may receive automatic error reports containing technical information about the problem. These reports are anonymized and contain no personal data, nutrition information, or user content.

**Contact Communications:** When you contact us for support, feedback, or inquiries, we collect the information you provide (name, email, message content) solely to respond to your request. We don't use this information for marketing or share it with third parties.

**Device Information:** We may collect basic device information (browser type, operating system, screen resolution) to ensure compatibility and optimize the user experience across different devices.

## Third-Party Services

**Google Services:** We use Google Ads for advertising and Google Analytics for anonymous usage statistics. You can opt out of personalized ads through your [Google Ad Settings](https://myadcenter.google.com/home).

**Dropbox:** If you choose to sync data, we connect directly to your Dropbox account. We never store your Dropbox data on our servers.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** View all data stored about you (though there's not much!)
- **Export:** Download your nutrition data anytime
- **Delete:** Remove all your data from your device
- **Portability:** Take your data to another app
- **Opt-out:** Disable cookies and analytics

## Data Security

Since your data stays on your device or in your personal cloud storage, you maintain complete control over its security. We use industry-standard security measures for our website and any minimal data we handle.

## Children's Privacy

Our service is not intended for children under 13. We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you're a parent and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## Global Privacy Compliance

We respect privacy laws worldwide, including GDPR (European Union), CCPA (California), PIPEDA (Canada), and other regional privacy regulations. Our privacy-first approach means we comply by design.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We'll notify you of any significant changes through the app or our website.

## Contact Us
