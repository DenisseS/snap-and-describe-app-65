# User Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome to NutriScan! This comprehensive nutrition tracking app helps you make informed food choices by providing detailed nutritional information, allergen warnings, and recipe suggestions.

Getting started is simple. The app works directly in your browser as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means no downloads from app stores are required. Simply bookmark our website or add it to your home screen for quick access.

If you want to sync your data across devices, you can optionally connect your Dropbox account for secure cloud synchronization while maintaining complete privacy.

## Navigation Basics

NutriScan features an intuitive navigation system designed for easy use on both mobile and desktop devices.

The bottom navigation bar provides quick access to the main sections: Home, Explore, Favorites, Recipes, and Camera scanning. You can tap any of these icons to instantly jump to that section.

Use the back button or swipe gestures to return to previous screens. The app remembers your navigation history and allows seamless browsing through different sections.

## Scanning Products

The heart of NutriScan is its smart product scanning capability that provides instant nutritional analysis.

To scan a product, tap the Camera icon in the bottom navigation. Point your camera at the product's barcode and hold steady until the scan completes. The app will automatically recognize the barcode and display detailed nutritional information.

Make sure to allow camera permissions when prompted, as this is essential for the scanning functionality. For best results, ensure good lighting and hold the camera steady about 6-8 inches from the barcode.

If barcode scanning doesn't work or isn't available, you can manually search for products using the search function. Simply type the product name and browse through the results.

## Understanding Results

When you scan or search for a product, NutriScan displays comprehensive nutritional information to help you make informed decisions.

The main nutritional panel shows macronutrients (calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats), vitamins and minerals, and overall health scores. Color-coded indicators help you quickly understand whether values are low, moderate, or high.

Health scores are calculated based on nutritional density, processing level, and overall nutritional value. Green indicates healthier options, yellow suggests moderate consumption, and red signals products to limit.

Pay special attention to allergen warnings, which appear prominently if the product contains ingredients you've marked as allergens in your profile settings.

## Managing Favorites

Keep track of products you use regularly by adding them to your favorites list.

To add a product to favorites, tap the heart icon when viewing product details. Favorited products appear in your Favorites section for quick access later.

You can organize your favorites by removing items you no longer need. Long-press or swipe on items in your favorites list to reveal delete options.

## Syncing Data

NutriScan offers optional cloud synchronization to keep your data consistent across all your devices while maintaining complete privacy.

To connect cloud sync, go to your profile settings and choose to connect your Dropbox account. This allows your favorites, settings, and data to sync securely across devices.

Your data is encrypted before being stored in your personal Dropbox account, ensuring that only you have access to your nutritional information. You can disconnect cloud sync at any time while keeping your data.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using NutriScan, here are common solutions:

**Scanning Issues:** Ensure your camera permissions are enabled, clean your camera lens, and try scanning in better lighting conditions. If barcode scanning fails, use the manual search function instead.

**Performance Issues:** Clear your browser cache, ensure you have a stable internet connection, and try refreshing the app. On mobile devices, closing other apps can free up memory for better performance.

**Sync Issues:** Check your internet connection and ensure your Dropbox account is properly connected. If problems persist, try disconnecting and reconnecting your Dropbox account in the settings.

## Tips for Best Experience

- **Regular Updates:** Keep your browser updated for the best performance and latest features.
- **Add to Home Screen:** Install the app on your home screen for quick access like a native app.
- **Explore Features:** Take time to explore all sections - Recipes, Blog, and Explore offer valuable nutritional insights.
